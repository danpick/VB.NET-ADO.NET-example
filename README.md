# VB.NET-ADO.NET-example

embedded SQL to link to MS Access and embedded HTML for report output. Typical A-Level project complexity, but strong use of coding conventions and techniques, producing readable and maintainable algorithms.

Built in Visual Studio Express 2012

Should compile for any CPU, but differing versions of MS Access can require a specific x86 or x64 compile, and subsequent moving of database and other files from debug folder to x86/debug or x64/debug folders.

Look in tblUsers table in database (debug folder0 for logins when running the software, and note that prototype has only data for 'Yorkshire Dales' area.

Any questions, email danpick77@gmail.com :-)
